This file states the number of cards in the original battalion game
It then splits them out via the 2 types of card available from the playbook - Boss and Mage
and then outlines the only type of card available from the trickbook - Trick
and then splits them remaining 3 types of card available from the main deck - Fighter, Captain and Leader
The only variable is the number of tower cards, which is 3 per player.
